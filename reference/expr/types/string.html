		<h3>string type</h3>
		<div>The <b>string</b> type is a type for text. Text surrounded by double qoutes <code>"</code> is parsed as a text token by Stage's token parser. Note: as of current time, it is not possible to escape the quote character to prevent a string from ending or starting, this may be changed in the future.</div>
		<h4>Type coercion</h4>
		<div>To number: conversion is attempted.</div>
		<div>To symbol: the string is converted as is to symbol.</div>
