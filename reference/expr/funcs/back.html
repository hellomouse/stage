		<h3>back</h3>
		<h4>Syntax</h4>
		<div>(back count:number)</div>
		<h4>Return</h4>
		<div>true.</div>
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<div><b>back</b> returns to a previous <a href='scene/marker.html'>marker</a> or <a href='scene/action.html'>non-blocking action</a>, note that scene change also produces a point at the start of the scene. By default the count is set to 1 allowing you to simply do <code>(back)</code>, the count is how many previous actions are skipped. In case you want to return to the latest action you may give a negative count, but that can be prone to creating infinite loops as back returns to the start of the action that called it.</div>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<label class="cont">Click to reveal example
			<input type="checkbox" />
			<pre>
/ This marker is unnecessary if this is at the start of the scene.
