		<h3>Subscenes</h3>
		<div>Subscenes are seperate "blocks" in a scene created by surrounding a section with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. Subscenes are used by certain characters such as <a href='scene/action.html'>action</a> and <a href='scene/evaluate.html'>evaluate</a>, and will normally be skipped by Stage.</div>
