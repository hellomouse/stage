		<h3><code>/</code> - Comment</h3>
		<div>The <b>Comment</b> character makes Stage ignore the rest of the line it is on. It can be made multiline by adding an <code>*</code> asterisk after it, multiline comments are terminated with <code>*/</code>. You may add a second slash to single-line comments if you prefer, but there is no function in doing so.</div>
